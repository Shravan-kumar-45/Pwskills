d= a-b
e =a/b
print("a+b :",c,d,e)


#modulus operator >> gives remainder

a= 34
b=35
c=b%a
print("b%a",c)

# floor division >> it gives you nearest integer
a= 34//16
print(a)
# exponential operator

a= 3**3
print(a)

# comparison operator >> compare two values >> return a boolean values

a= 3==3
print(a)
