        "\n",
        "**1.  What is python, and why is it popolar?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Python is a programming language that allows computers to comprehend human commands because computers are unable to understand human language.\n",
        "It help computer to follow set of intruction given by a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Example :- Suppose there is a Russian friend of yours and you dont know about anything other than english launguge and you want to communicate with your russian friend. Now, you look for a tranlator who can translate your words to your russian friend. Same way, the programming help us to communicate with computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several reason for python been so much popular:-\n",
        "- Its has vast library collection for the user.\n",
        "- Its easy and simple to understand to the beginners.\n",
        "- Its has huge community of people who share codes to the community.\n",
        "- It widely used in the popular industries.\n",
        "- Cross-Platform\n",
        "- Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.  What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code so that the computer can understand and execute it. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code at once, an interpreter processes the code one instruction at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**  Pre-defined Keywords are known as reserved words. There pre-defined keywords hold a specific meaning and specific purpose.\n",
        "There are several types of pre- defined keywords:-\n",
        "\n",
        "**A. Numeric type**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   int(43,89,78)\n",
        "-float(85.59,98.99)\n",
        "-complex:- comples number with real and imaginary part(34 + 87j)\n",
        "\n",
        "**B. Sequence types**\n",
        "*   str [strings of character]\n",
        "-list - mutable sequence of elements [1,2,3]\n",
        "-tuple - immutable sequence (1,3,4)\n",
        "\n",
        "**C. Mapping types**\n",
        "* dict - Mutable collection of key-value pair {'abc':34,'shravan':45}\n",
        "\n",
        "**D. Set types**\n",
        "* set - Mutable collection of unique elements {1,2,3}\n",
        "- frozenset - Immutable collection of unique elements. Ex:- frozenset({1,2,3})\n",
        "\n",
        "**E. Boolean type**\n",
        "* bool - Boolean values representing True or False\n",
        "\n",
        "**F. None type**\n",
        "* None - A special object representing the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** No, keywords can't be as variable because keyswords are special words which holds special meaning and special fuction in the python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you use print='shravan'.\n",
        "Now, print store value as shravan and you recalled print to display the result of the code than it give us error and you restart the kernal to get again real work of print.\n",
        "So, avoiding this thing we dont use keywords to store varible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.  What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Mulability in python means objects which can be edited after there creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex:- List, Dictionaries, Sets and user defined classess(unless, explicity designed to be immutable)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**Lists are mutable in Python because they are designed for situations where the collection of items can change over time, allowing for additions, deletions, or modifications. Tuples are immutable to provide fixed, reliable collections of data, ensuring that their contents cannot be altered once created. This immutability makes tuples more memory-efficient and hashable (usable as dictionary keys), while lists offer greater flexibility but require more memory and processing for modifications. The choice between lists and tuples depends on whether you need a changeable or fixed collection of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-*\"==\" is a comparison operator which can be used when you need to compare between things while \"is\" is a identity operaor which are used to compare the memory location of two ojects.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Example:- 5==6 # it return false\n",
        "\n",
        " 5 is 5 # it return True beacuse both location are same.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8.  What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Logical operator are used to combine and manipulate boolean values.\n",
        "There are several types of logical operators:-\n",
        "* **a.Logical AND**\n",
        "Returns True id both condition are true.\n",
        "* **b.Logical OR**\n",
        "Returns True if at least one of condition is True.\n",
        "* **c.Logical NOT**\n",
        "Its used to convert True to false and vice-versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9.  What is type casting in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Type casting is named of coverting one data type to another by user manually.\n",
        "For Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "a= '3'\n",
        "type(a) # its shows it as string\n",
        "\n",
        "int(a) # type casting is used to convert str to int\n",
        "\n",
        "type(a) # Now, it shows it as integer\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**  Implicit type casting where python automatically convert data type to another while in explicit type casting convesion of data type done by user, using inbuilt fuction of python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implicit type casting**\n",
        "\n",
        "a = 5        # int\n",
        "\n",
        "b = 2.5      # float\n",
        "\n",
        "result = a + b  # Python automatically converts 'a' to float\n",
        "\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 7.5\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explicit type casting**\n",
        "\n",
        "a = \"10\"\n",
        "\n",
        "b = int(a)  # Explicit conversion of string to integer\n",
        "\n",
        "print(b)     # Output: 10\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-**The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions or criteria. They enable the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.\n",
        "There are different type of conditional statement:-\n",
        "\n",
        "* 1.If statement\n",
        "*2.Else statement\n",
        "*3.Elif statement\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. How does the elif statement work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** Elif statement used where multiple conditions present in the situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Example:-\n",
        "\n",
        "x = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "if x < 5:\n",
        "\n",
        "print(\"x is less than 5\")\n",
        "\n",
        "elif x == 10:\n",
        "\n",
        "print(\"x is 10\")\n",
        "\n",
        "elif x > 5:\n",
        "\n",
        "print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",
        "\n",
        "else:\n",
        "\n",
        "print(\"x is something else\")\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output: X is 10**\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:-** For loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
        "While loop repeatedly executed a block of code as long as a given condition is True. The condition is checked before each iteration and if it become false the loop is exited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "for i in range(3):\n",
        "\n",
        "print(i)  \n",

        "\n",
        "**While Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "i = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "while i < 3:\n",
        "\n",
        "print(i)\n",
